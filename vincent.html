<p>He is also a primary school registered teacher as well. <br> Vincent has been so closer to the Vice Chair and the Chairman, even before he was given the position he is currently holding. <br> He is trusted the most when it comes to discussing important matters that are benefiting to us. <br> His sacrifices alongside the Chairman has helped 21DP the most.
