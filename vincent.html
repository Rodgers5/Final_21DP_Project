<h3><b>OYUGI VINCENT</b></h3>
<h4><b>General Secretary - 2021 -> Present</b></h4>
<p>He is also a primary school registered teacher as well. Vincent has been so closer to the Vice Chair and the Chairman, even before he was given the position he is currently holding. He is trusted the most when it comes to discussing serious issues that are benefiting to us.
        His sacrifices alongside the Chairman has helped 21DP the most.
