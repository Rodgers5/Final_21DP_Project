    <h3><b>SCOVIA SABATIA</b></h3>
    <h4>Assistant Secretary since 2021.</h4>
<P>She is bold and brave amongst us. She was favoured by the board to hold her space. She has been supportive to the executive whebever the General Secretary is not available. <br> She is generous and always available to assist whoever needs her assistance. <br> Her hand signs may be different from Kenyan Sign Language, but trust us, she is far in understanding and writing beyond that.</P>
