    <h3><b>FRANCIS WAIGANJO</b></h3>
    <h4><b>Welfare Officer since 2020.</b></h4>

    <P>He is the most obedient and brave member we ever have! The most supportive as well. <br> He stands with each and every member of our organization when the time of need comes. <br> He has always insisted on physical meeting whenever it comes to our gathering, which has encouraged all to sacrifice their time and come together as a family. The executive greatly admired and appreciated his ways. <br> Surely when we come togethre, great things happen.</P>
